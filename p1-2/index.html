    <p>
      When all of the dots in a stage is eaten, that stage is completed and the player will advance to the next one. Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays.The four ghosts roam the maze and chase Pac-Man. If Pac-man comes into contact with a ghost, he loses a life. The game ends when all lives have been lost. The player will receive one extra life after obtaining 10,000 points. The number of points needed for a bonus life can be changed to 15,000, 20,000, or disabled altogether. Near the corners of the maze are four flashing Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where the ghost is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Pac-Man is an arcade game designed by Toru Iwatani of Namco and first released in Japan as Puck Man in May 1980. Licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway Games, it was released in October 1980 when top arcade games were stark space shooters, such as Namco Galaxian, and Asteroids. Pac-Man established the conventions of the maze chase genre, and is considered one of the classics of the medium and an icon of 1980s popular culture. The game and subsequent entries in the seriesâ€”became a social phenomenon that crossed over to other media, such as the Pac-Man animated television series and the top-ten Buckner and Garcia single "Pac-Man Fever." Dozens of similarly-styled maze games appeared over the next several years, with some becoming successful in their own right.
